# README Maker

## Description

This repository was created so I could create a comand-line application that utilizes user input to creare a markdown readme file. You can watch a video demonstrating the application's functionallity by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zRFfUm2rze-rIrQnXd2W0hFzSULy9_QQ/view?usp=sharing).

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript and the following Node.js packages: the built in "fs" and "util" packages, and an installed via npm package called "inquirer" to write my applicatian's code.



### Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). And after you've cloned or downloaded the repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary "inquirer" package (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file).



### Usage

To use my command-line application you'll nead to clone or download the repository. If you have everything installed, you simply have to have your terminal in the same direcetory as index.js and use the command "node index.js" to run it. Once it runs you will be prompted for information that is to be included in the readme. After answering all prompts, in that same directory you will find a file named "userREADME.md" and in this file is the generated readme for your readme needs.



### Credits

I used Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) and the "inquirer" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
